"""
How does merge sort work?
The merge requires two pointers to compare between two separate arrays after it is split.

1. Find the length of the unsorted array; divide this by 2 and round up if it is odd
(7/2 should be rounded to 4)
2. Every time we compare the elements in the split arrays,
which ever is lower, we merge that elem into new array, and then
move the pointer for its array
