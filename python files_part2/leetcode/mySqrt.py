"""
Determine the square root of number without using built-in functions
 sqrt(4) = 2
 sqrt(8) = 2.8... = 2
 sqrt(49) = 7 
 
 1. scan thru the loop from 1 to n, take the exponent of each i until it equals  the number;
 2. if it doesn't equal, round down to that number and use that it instead. 
 
 ex. if we want to find sqrt of 49, we wrap a loop from 1 to i, and take the exponent of i until it
 equals to 49. If it doesn't equal, exactly, take the closest number and round down.
